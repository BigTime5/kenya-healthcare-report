# Healthcare Access and Insurance Coverage Analysis 🏥

*A Comprehensive Data-Driven Study of Kenya's Healthcare Landscape*

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project presents a rigorous examination of healthcare access patterns, insurance coverage disparities, and utilization behaviors across Kenya's diverse population. Through advanced statistical analysis of **6,158 survey responses**, we uncover critical gaps in the current healthcare ecosystem that demand immediate policy intervention.

### 🚨 Key Finding

### 2. Employment Status Impact
- **Employed**: 79.1% insured
- **Unemployed**: 33.8% insured
- **Gap**: 45.3 percentage points

### 3. NHIF Market Dominance
- **Market share**: 78.8% among insured population
- **Total NHIF users**: 2,805 of 3,558 insured respondents

### 4. Preventive Care Crisis
- **Cancer screening**: Only 23.8% participation
- **Routine check-ups**: Only 29.1% participation
- **Age disparity**: 16.8% (18-30) vs 63.3% (60+) for routine care

### 5. Geographic Disparities
- **Coverage range**: 43.8% to 67.3% across regions
- **Geographic gap**: 23.5 percentage points

### 6. Insurance Underutilization
- **Hospital visit insurance usage**: Only 46.5%
- **Coverage vs. utilization gap**: Significant disconnect

## 🏛️ Policy Recommendations

### Priority 1: Income-Graduated NHIF Premium Structure
- Implement sliding scale premiums
- Provide 75% subsidies for <10K KSH households
- Expected impact: Increase low-income coverage to 60%+

### Priority 2: Universal Employment-Based Enrollment
- Mandate employer NHIF contributions
- Create informal sector voluntary schemes
- Expected impact: 90%+ coverage among employed

### Priority 3: Comprehensive Preventive Care Package
- Include annual check-ups in basic NHIF
- Mandate age-appropriate cancer screening
- Expected impact: Increase routine care access to 50%+

### Priority 4: Regional Access Equity Initiative
- Deploy mobile enrollment centers
- Implement regional premium adjustments
- Expected impact: Reduce regional gap to <10%

### Priority 5: Insurance Utilization Enhancement
- Simplify claims processes
- Implement real-time verification systems
- Expected impact: Increase utilization to 75%+

## 💰 Implementation Analysis

- **Target Coverage**: 85% (from current 57.8%)
- **Additional Population**: 13.6 million people
- **Estimated Annual Cost**: 19.6 billion KSH (~$163 million)
- **Cost per Person**: 1,440 KSH annually
